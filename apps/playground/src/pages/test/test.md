Here's a Button component:

<Button label="Click Me" severity="primary" />

And another one with different props:

<Button label="Success Button" severity="success" variant="soft" />

```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

<Button label="Success Button" severity="success" variant="soft" />;

console.log(add(a, b));
```
